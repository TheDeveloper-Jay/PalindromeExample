# PalindromeExample

Example asked in interviewing.io

Q. Given two strings, A and B, of equal length, find whether it is possible to split both strings at the same index such that merging the first part of A and the second part of B forms a palindrome. Return the location of the split. Palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward.
If the solution can not be found, return -1.

Example1:
"abcd efgh" and 
"dase dcba" return 4, since we can split the strings like "abcd" and "dcba"

Example2:
wooo p<br/>
piuy w<br/>
